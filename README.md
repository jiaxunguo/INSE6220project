Principal component analysis (PCA) is a multivariate technique and a standard tool in modern data analysis for simplifying complex data sets. It is based on linear correlation to transform original variables into new uncorrelated variables. In this report, PCA is applied to a data set of date fruits and reduce the feature dimensions for the classification of date fruit types. A lot of fruits are grownup within the world, every of that has varied types. Determining the types of a same fruit by looking at their appearance is time and effort consuming. This report will introduce three popular classifiers to be applied to the date fruits data set: Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Decision Tree. F1-score will be the metric for assessing the performance of each model. Besides, confusion matrix and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are provided in the end. As an additional part, the most famous classifiers will be applied on our date set to be looking for the best model by an advanced Python Library (PyCaret).
